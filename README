Utility for creating a pipe from a shell script.

Description
===========
mkpipe  make a pipe, print to stdout own pid and wait until killed by a
caller.  mkpipe is intended to be used from a bash script when there is
a  need  to  collect  an  output  from  more  than one descriptor sepa-
rately(i.e. stdout and stderr). For example, if we have some program(or
another  script)  that  output to stdout some needed data on success or
output to stderr an error message on failure and these messages are in-
termixed.  Or  we  need  to run many programs in a subshell and process
stdout and stderr separately.

After start mkpipe create a pipe with descriptor 3 connected to it read
end and descriptor 4 connected to it write end.  After that, it reports
it own pid to stdout and wait with help of pause() call.

There is mkpipe.sh which is usually located in /usr/lib/mkpipe/.   This
utility  script  contains  3  useful  functions which simplify using of
mkpipe in your scripts. See MKPIPE.SH section below.


Install
=======

make install command will install mkpipe binary in /usr/local/bin/
and mkpipe.sh in /usr/lib/mkpipe/.

Options
=======

-B       create pipe with O_NONBLOCK
-c       create pipe with O_CLOEXEC
-s BYTES set pipe size to BYTES
-v       show program version
-h       show this help

Using
=====

Include mkpipe.sh in your script:

. /usr/lib/mkpipe/mkpipe.sh

Then use it:

mkpipe 5 6
({
  SOME
  SCRIPT
  HERE
} 1>&6)
read_all data <&5

echo $data

rmpipe 5 6

Examples
========

See example.sh.

Rationale
=========

Sometimes there is need to execute some commands in a subshell and we need to
collect an output from stdout and stderr(and sometimes from even more file
descriptors; e.g. our script need to collect an output from 4 fd - 1, 2, 3
and 4 - where 1 is used for a data, 2 for errors, 3 is used for error which
should be sent to a client and 4 for debug messages).
Thus, simple:

data=$(commands here)

isn't enough for this case. We can use files as a temporary storage for an output:

({commands here} >data.out 2>err.out 3>err_client.out 4>debug.out)

But with read-only fs this doesn't work.

We can use the next shell function:

# Create a pipe
#  $1 - read fd
#  $2 - write fd
mkpipe()
{
	local PID1 PID2
	local FD_READ FD_WRITE

	FD_READ=$1
	FD_WRITE=$2
	tail -f /dev/null | tail -f /dev/null &
	PID2=$!
	PID1=`jobs -p %+`
	# Is this enough to finish with children?
	sleep 1s
	eval "exec $FD_READ</proc/$PID2/fd/0 $FD_WRITE>/proc/$PID1/fd/1"
	disown $PID1
	kill $PID1 $PID2
}

But look at sleep call. Here we have a race condition.
How big it should be in order to be guaranteed to work correctly?
So, we need something that do not require a magic with timeout
tweaking.
